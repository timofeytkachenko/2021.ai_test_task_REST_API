# Bank Marketing Prediction API

A FastAPI-based REST API for predicting customer subscription to a bank financial product using a CatBoost machine learning model.

## Overview

This application serves a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a bank financial product. The prediction is based on various customer attributes and economic indicators.

The API is containerized using Docker and can be easily deployed using Docker Compose.

## Model Information

The prediction service uses a CatBoost classifier, an efficient implementation of gradient boosting on decision trees. 

Download **catboost_model.cbm** from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nPxZG83z2rtZHkHT9qVCriwaYN8dOzOB/view?usp=drive_link) and place it in the *app* directory.

## Features

- High-performance predictions using CatBoost
- Comprehensive input validation
- Feature engineering pipeline integrated into the API
- Health check endpoint for monitoring
- Model information endpoint for transparency
- Both single and batch prediction endpoints
- Containerized for easy deployment
- Resource limiting for predictable performance

## API Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /model-info` - Information about the loaded model
- `POST /predict` - Make predictions for one or more customers
- `POST /batch-predict` - Alias for predict, optimized for batch processing

## Input Data Schema

The API accepts customer data with the following attributes:

- `age`: Customer age (â‰¤100)
- `occupation`: Type of job/occupation (housemaid, services, admin., blue-collar, technician, retired, management, unemployed, self-employed, unknown, entrepreneur, student)
- `marital_status`: Marital status (married, single, divorced, unknown)
- `education`: Education level (basic.4y, high.school, basic.6y, basic.9y, professional.course, unknown, university.degree, illiterate)
- `has_credit`: Has credit in default (yes/no/unknown)
- `housing_loan`: Has housing loan (yes/no/unknown)
- `personal_loan`: Has personal loan (yes/no/unknown) 
- `contact_mode`: Contact communication mode (cellular, telephone)
- `month`: Last contact month (3-letter code: jan, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec)
- `week_day`: Last contact day of the week (3-letter code: mon, tue, wed, thu, fri)
- `last_contact_duration`: Last contact duration in seconds (<3600)
- `contacts_per_campaign`: Number of contacts during this campaign (<50)
- `previous_outcome`: Outcome of previous campaign (nonexistent, failure, success)
- `emp_var_rate`: Employment variation rate (-10.0 to 10.0)
- `cons_price_index`: Consumer price index (80.0 to 110.0)
- `cons_conf_index`: Consumer confidence index (-50.0 to 20.0)
- `euri_3_month`: Euribor 3 month rate (-2.0 to 10.0)
- `nb_employees`: Number of employees - quarterly indicator (4000.0 to 6500.0)

## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- The CatBoost model file (`catboost_model.cbm`)

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
MODEL_PATH=catboost_model.cbm
PREDICTION_THRESHOLD=0.494
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Running with Docker Compose

1. Clone this repository
2. Download the model file and place it in the `app` directory
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. The API will be available at http://localhost:8000

## Example Usage

### Request

```json
{
    "customers": [
        {
            "age": 41,
            "occupation": "technician",
            "marital_status": "married",
            "education": "university.degree",
            "has_credit": "no",
            "housing_loan": "yes",
            "personal_loan": "no",
            "contact_mode": "cellular",
            "month": "may",
            "week_day": "mon",
            "last_contact_duration": 180,
            "contacts_per_campaign": 2,
            "previous_outcome": "success",
            "emp_var_rate": -0.1,
            "cons_price_index": 93.2,
            "cons_conf_index": -36.4,
            "euri_3_month": 0.6,
            "nb_employees": 5099.1
        }
    ]
}
```

### Response

```json
{
    "predictions": [
        {
            "customer_index": 0,
            "probability": 0.7065408241747142,
            "prediction": 1,
            "prediction_label": "yes"
        }
    ],
    "model_version": "catboost_model.cbm",
    "threshold_used": 0.494,
    "processing_time_ms": 13.617992401123047
}
```

## Development

For development, you can mount the app directory as a volume to enable hot reloading by modifying the volumes section in docker-compose.yml to use the development volume mapping.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:timofeytkachenko/2021.ai_test_task_REST_API.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 2021.ai_test_task_REST_API
   ```
3. Run Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Performance Considerations

- The API is configured to use 1 CPU core and 1GB of memory by default
- For higher throughput, adjust the resource limits in docker-compose.yml
- The number of workers can be modified in the Dockerfile CMD
